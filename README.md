# GetRepos

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.1. <br>
This was done as a mini project in my application for an internship at Taiger. <br>

## To set up this project

Run `npm i` to install all necessary packages.

You need to have Angular 9 installed. <br>
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
